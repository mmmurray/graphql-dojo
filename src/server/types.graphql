# This file is where you define the schema using the GraphQL Schema Language. Helpful language cheat sheet:

#
# Requirements for the schema:
#
# - I can get a station by name.
#
# - For a particular station:
#    - I can get the name of the station.
#    - I can get a list of all the trams due to depart from the station.
#
# - For each departing tram:
#    - I can get the size of the tram (Metrolink trams are either Single or Double size).
#    - I can get the time in minutes when the tram is due to depart from the station.
#    - I can get the name of the destination station.

# All schemas must define a Query type. GraphQL will use this as the entry point to your schema.
# type Query {
#
# }

type Query {
  stations: [Station]!
  station(name: String): Station
}

type Station {
  name: String
  trams: [Tram]!
  location: Location
}

type Location {
  lat: Float
  lon: Float
}

type Tram {
  destination: Station
  due: Int
  size: TramSize
}

enum TramSize {
  Single
  Double
}
