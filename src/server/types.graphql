# This file is where you define the schema using the GraphQL Schema Language. Helpful language cheat sheet:

#
# Requirements for the schema:
#
# - I can get the names of all the stations.
#
# - I can get a particular station by name.
#
# - For a particular station:
#    - I can get the name of the station.
#    - I can get a list of all the trams due to depart from the station.
#
# - For each departing tram:
#    - I can get the size of the tram (Metrolink trams are either Single or Double size).
#    - I can get the time in minutes when the tram is due to depart from the station.
#    - I can get the name of the destination station.

# All schemas must define a Query type. GraphQL will use this as the entry point to your schema.
# type Query {
#
# }

type Query {
  # Get all of the Metrolink stations.
  stations: [Station]!

  # Get a Metrolink station by name.
  station(name: String): Station
}

# The place where trams stop.
type Station {
  # The name of the station.
  name: String

  # Get all of the departing trams from this station.
  trams: [Tram]!

  # The location of the station.
  location: Location
}

# A physical location in the world.
type Location {
  lat: Float
  lon: Float
}

# A Metrolink tram due to arrive at a station.
type Tram {
  # The station where the tram is headed.
  destination: Station

  # Number of minutes until the tram arrives.
  due: Int

  # The length of the tram in carriages.
  size: Int
}
